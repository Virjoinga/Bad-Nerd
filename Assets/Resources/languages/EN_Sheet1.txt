<entry name="side10_3">Popular Kid==&gt;Probably because your mom is a whore! HAHAHAHA!</entry>
<entry name="side10_4">You==&gt;I&apos;m taking your ice cream. You mean person!</entry>

<entry name="zom13_1">You==&gt;So how do I take out the zombie commanders?</entry>
<entry name="zom13_2">Strange Kid==&gt;They are really powerful.  You need to collect enough zombie drool or you won&apos;t be strong enough to survive their attacks.</entry>
<entry name="zom13_3">Strange Kid==&gt;Are you ready to fight the first commander?</entry>
<entry name="main1_19b">Student==&gt;Look at your map.</entry>
<entry name="gen_p2_l1_1">You==&gt;Hey, what are you doing here?</entry>
<entry name="gen_p2_l1_2">Kid==&gt;I&apos;m too scared...I don&apos;t know what to do!</entry>
<entry name="gen_p2_l1_3">You==&gt;You should go home.  Head to the playground, and from there you can run home!</entry>
<entry name="gen_p2_l1_4">Kid==&gt;I&apos;m afraid there might be zombies behind the door...</entry>
<entry name="gen_p2_l1_5">You==&gt;OK, I&apos;ll go make sure the playground has no zombies.  Come meet me there in a few minutes, it should be safe by then.</entry>

<entry name="main2_14">You==&gt;Do you have my comic books?</entry>
<entry name="main2_15">Messenger==&gt;No.  T-Steak has it! But you don&apos;t want to mess with him!</entry>
<entry name="main2_16">You==&gt;Who is T-Steak?</entry>

<entry name="side13_9">Fight Master==&gt;That&apos;s a good choice! We host these tournaments in almost every section of the school.</entry>
<entry name="zom21_1">You==&gt;Hey... You should stop standing here, it&apos;s not safe.</entry>
<entry name="main2_21">Messenger==&gt;I have a message for you. T-Steak sends his regards.</entry>
<entry name="main2_22">You==&gt;What do you mean?</entry>
<entry name="main2_23">Messenger==&gt;It means I&apos;m here to beat you up for being cocky.</entry>
<entry name="main2_24">You==&gt;I&apos;m just looking for my comic books.</entry>
<entry name="main2_25">Messenger==&gt;Well, maybe this will convince you to stop!</entry>
<entry name="zom16_1">Strange Kid==&gt;You are still alive!  That&apos;s amazing!</entry>
<entry name="zom16_2">Strange Kid==&gt;Are you ready to fight the Lizard King?</entry>
<entry name="controllerNotConnected">Controller NOT connected!</entry>
<entry name="levelTooLow">You need to have _PLACEHOLDER_ before getting this.</entry>
<entry name="needDrools150">Strange Kid==&gt;Sorry but you need at least 150 bottles of zombie drool before you can fight the commander!  Otherwise it is too dangerous!</entry>
<entry name="main16_10">T-Bones==&gt;Oh you weren&apos;t here just now. This nice man gave me some white powder.  He said it&apos;s candy powder.</entry>
<entry name="side1_1">You==&gt;Hello.  Why do you look so scared?</entry>
<entry name="side1_2">Student==&gt;Do I?</entry>
<entry name="side1_3">You==&gt;Yeah you are sweating like a goose!</entry>
<entry name="side1_4">Student==&gt;Well, you see.  I&apos;m embarrassed to admit this.  But I&apos;m being picked on by 2 girls.  They are twins.  And they are tough!</entry>
<entry name="side1_5">You==&gt;That&apos;s nothing to be ashamed of. A bully is a bully!  Doesn&apos;t matter what age, sex, or race.</entry>
<entry name="side1_6">You==&gt;What do they do to you?</entry>
<entry name="side1_7">Student==&gt;They beat me up. And threaten to cut my hair...</entry>
<entry name="side1_8">You==&gt;Yikes...</entry>
<entry name="side1_9">Student==&gt;Thanks so much for the help! I won&apos;t forget you!</entry>
<entry name="zom12_1a">You==&gt;How many zombies are there?!?</entry>
<entry name="zom19_1">You==&gt;Hey you ok?</entry>
<entry name="zom19_2">3rd Brother==&gt;Thanks for saving my life!</entry>
<entry name="zom19_3">You==&gt;Well you better go home now.  Your 2 brothers have already gone home.</entry>
<entry name="zom19_4">3rd Brother==&gt;But I can&apos;t go yet!  I want to put a sculpture of mine in the art gallery while no one is looking.</entry>
<entry name="zom19_5">You==&gt;This is not the best time for that.</entry>
<entry name="zom19_6">3rd Brother==&gt;No this is the only time!  The teachers don&apos;t appreciate my art, so I have to put it there while they are not looking.</entry>
<entry name="zom19_7">You==&gt;&lt;Sigh...&gt; OK.. Let me go make sure the art gallery is safe first.</entry>
<entry name="gen_p3_l3_1">Kid==&gt;Hey!  I&apos;m here.  What should we do now?</entry>
<entry name="gen_p3_l3_2">You==&gt;Sorry, I think we took the wrong way... but it&apos;s too late now!</entry>
<entry name="gen_p3_l3_3">Kid==&gt;I knew it!  Now what?!?</entry>
<entry name="gen_p3_l3_4">You==&gt;Don&apos;t be scared.  I have this under control.  Meet me in the BRIGHT HALL.  I&apos;ll go make sure it&apos;s free of zombies first.</entry>

<entry name="zom3_1">You==&gt;Did you just turn off the lights?  I thought you were going to do something crazy, like go around beating up all the bullies.. hahah!!  I guess you are not as bad as me after all!</entry>
<entry name="zom3_2">Strange Kid==&gt;Turning off the light is just part of my master plan.  Kids are scared of the dark, but there&apos;s much more to come, you just wait and see...  oh.. here comes my evil laugh...  wait...</entry>
<entry name="zom3_3">Strange Kid==&gt;Mwuuaa... &lt;cough&gt; Mwuaahahahahhahaha!!!</entry>

<entry name="side4_1">Artistic Man==&gt;Hey Kid...</entry>
<entry name="side4_2">You==&gt;Yes sir.  How can I help you?</entry>
<entry name="side7_10">Little Thug==&gt;Just.. Just shut up ok! And die!!!</entry>

<entry name="side4_6">Artistic Man==&gt;You enjoy art?</entry>
<entry name="side4_7">You==&gt;Yeah, like comic books and stuff like that.</entry>
<entry name="side4_8">Artistic Man==&gt;You should come over to my place, I have lots of comic books!</entry>
<entry name="side4_9">You==&gt;Really? Cool!</entry>

<entry name="twirpDoneWell">Teacher==&gt;Twirp here has done really well on  the quiz.  He gets to take these limited edition comic books to read  at the library!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_1">Strange Kid==&gt;Psss.. Over here!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_2">You==&gt;Hey aren&apos;t you the kid that turned the lights off?  You shouldn&apos;t be here, there are zombies roaming the school!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_3">Strange Kid==&gt;I know!  That was my master plan!  But it backfired on me, the zombies don&apos;t obey me at all!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_4">Strange Kid==&gt;Yesterday during a back-to-school experiment in science class I altered the chemicals by assigning the polymers in a recursive manner which triggers the instantiation and airborn of the T-Cells!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_5">You==&gt;Oh no!  That&apos;s bad news!  Good thing I missed school yesterday!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_6">Strange Kid==&gt;Yah!  Most kids caught the T-Cell Virus, but some kids missed school, and some kids have too much boogers so they didn&apos;t breathe in the virus and so they did not get infected.</entry>
<entry name="zom11_7">You==&gt;Yikes, there are a few coming over here!  Let me take care of them first.</entry>
<entry name="side5_10">You==&gt;Why is it just some white powder? Looks like drugs to me.</entry>
<entry name="side5_11">You==&gt;I don&apos;t trust you!</entry>
<entry name="side5_12">Candy Man==&gt;Shh.... don&apos;t be so loud!</entry>
<entry name="side5_13">You==&gt;You&apos;re a bad guy! I&apos;m going to tell on you!</entry>
<entry name="main2_1">Student==&gt;Hi, the word in the halls is that you are looking for the bullies who took your books.</entry>
<entry name="main2_2">You==&gt; ... [Frown] I&apos;d very much like to have them back. Can you help?</entry>
<entry name="main2_3">Student==&gt;No way I&apos;m saying anything. I don&apos;t want to get beat up.</entry>
<entry name="main2_4">You==&gt;Ok, I understand.</entry>
<entry name="main2_5">Student==&gt;You shouldn&apos;t mess with them.  They are really mean people.</entry>
<entry name="main2_6">Student==&gt;Everyone is scared of them.</entry>
<entry name="main2_7">Student==&gt;Just watch out for anyone with a mohawk.  If you see them in the halls, just walk   the other way.</entry>
<entry name="main2_8">You==&gt;Thanks.  But I can&apos;t just give up my comic books.</entry>
<entry name="main2_9">Student==&gt;I gotta go...</entry>
<entry name="zom6_2">Repair Man==&gt;I think so, I&apos;m an expert at fixing things after all!  But I left my tools in the washroom when I was fixing the toilet just now.</entry>
<entry name="zom6_3">Repair Man==&gt;Go get it for me and I&apos;ll help you fix the lights.</entry>
<entry name="zom6_4">Repair Man==&gt;Look at the map if you don&apos;t know where it is, it&apos;s the RED &quot;!&quot; mark.</entry>
<entry name="needBackPack">You need a backpack that can handle more items!</entry>
<entry name="side7_1">Little Thug==&gt;Yo wussup! Nice socks negro! You gonna give it to us or should we take it from you?</entry>
<entry name="side7_2">You==&gt;Err... I&apos;m not a negro.. And neither are you white boy.</entry>
<entry name="side7_3">Little Thug==&gt;Who you calling a white boy?!  That shiz is deep yo!!</entry>
<entry name="side7_4">You==&gt;You are white and you are a boy. But you are talking like you are something else...</entry>
<entry name="side7_5">Little Thug==&gt;What the f*&amp;# n#gg&amp;! I ain&apos;t gonna lie, you got balls speaking to me with yo chest!</entry>
<entry name="side7_6">Little Thug==&gt;But right now, some shiz is about to go down here nerd boy!</entry>
<entry name="side7_7">You==&gt;What&apos;s going down?  You mean you pooped your pants and it&apos;s going down on the floor?</entry>
<entry name="side7_8">Little Thug==&gt;That&apos;s it!  Let&apos;s get this n*gg&amp;!!</entry>
<entry name="side7_9">You==&gt;That&apos;s a racist word against black people. It&apos;s not nice.. but I&apos;m not black either.  You confuse me...</entry>
<entry name="blockTut1">Hold button &quot;B&quot; to block.  It will reduce attack damage and prevent you from being knocked down.</entry>
<entry name="blockTut2">To execute a counter attack, release button &quot;B&quot; right when the enemy attacks.  You need to get the counter attack skill at the store.</entry>
<entry name="zran3">What time is it?</entry>
<entry name="zran4">Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</entry>
<entry name="zran5">Who turned off the lights!</entry>
<entry name="zran6">Darned tootin&apos;...What happened to the lights!</entry>
<entry name="zran7">This is bad....</entry>
<entry name="zran8">I have a bad feeling about this place.</entry>
<entry name="ending2_1">The zombies have risen!</entry>
<entry name="ending2_2">This is bad...</entry>

<entry name="main5_2">You==&gt;Um hi, where did you come from?</entry>
<entry name="side35_1">Student==&gt;You should get a backpack!</entry>
<entry name="side35_2">Student==&gt;Where is your backpack?</entry>
<entry name="side35_3">You==&gt;I don&apos;t have one.</entry>
<entry name="side35_4">Student==&gt;Did you know that if you don&apos;t have a backpack you won&apos;t be able to carry all the good stuff you find?</entry>
<entry name="side35_5">Student==&gt;So if you find a cool toy, and you used it till it broke, you will have to throw it out.</entry>
<entry name="side35_6">Student==&gt;But if you had a backpack, you could put it there first then fix the cool toy when you get the chance later.</entry>
<entry name="side35_7">Student==&gt;Up to you!  I just thought I&apos;d tell you so you don&apos;t miss out!</entry>
<entry name="zom9_2">You==&gt;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll protect you!</entry>
<entry name="zom9_3">School Mate==&gt;Sorry Bad Nerd, I know you are a good fighter but I think I should go home...</entry>
<entry name="zom9_4">You==&gt;Oh... ok then.  Well I&apos;ll see you tomorrow.  I have to make sure the school is ok.  Have I mentioned before how important it is for me to get good grades?</entry>

<entry name="side3_13">Rich Kid==&gt;Well, there&apos;s a kid who&apos;s always forcing me to give up my lunch. I eat steak for lunch you see.</entry>
<entry name="side3_14">Rich Kid==&gt;I need you to send the kid a message.</entry>
<entry name="side3_15">You==&gt;What&apos;s the message?</entry>
<entry name="side3_16">Rich Kid==&gt;&quot;No more steak for you.&quot;</entry>
<entry name="side3_17">You==&gt;You said something about making money...</entry>

<entry name="side3_19">Rich Kid==&gt;Nice work!</entry>
<entry name="main2_20">You==&gt;Me?  I&apos;m a nerd?</entry>
<entry name="side3_21">Rich Kid==&gt;The pig is in the cafeteria eating my steak right now. Wanna help me out?</entry>
<entry name="side3_22">Bullette==&gt;Why are you staring at my steak!</entry>
<entry name="side3_23">You==&gt;You must be the one...</entry>
<entry name="side3_24">Bullette==&gt;What one?</entry>
<entry name="side3_25">You==&gt;That&apos;s not your steak. I have a message for you.</entry>
<entry name="side3_26">You==&gt;&quot;No more steak for you.&quot;</entry>
<entry name="side3_27">Bullette==&gt;Hahah... you think I&apos;m scared of you?</entry>
<entry name="main5_11">Jones==&gt;It would also help if you learned some new fighting techniques.</entry>
<entry name="main5_12">Jones==&gt;Go to the Main Hall. That&apos;s where you can find a small library.  I&apos;ve seen quite a few books there about martial arts!</entry>

<entry name="main8_8">Yikes.  I guess I got T-Steak in trouble.  I better go see if he&apos;s still alive!</entry>

<entry name="main3_18">You==&gt;May I please ask you a question? Do you know a guy called T-Steak?</entry>
<entry name="gen_p3_l1_5">You==&gt;OK, we&apos;re going to go from room to room.  I&apos;ll make sure it&apos;s safe and then you come meet me.</entry>
<entry name="gen_p3_l1_6">You==&gt;Come meet me at the AUDITORIUM in a couple minutes.  I&apos;m going to go make sure it&apos;s safe there first.</entry>

<entry name="main15_2">T-Steak==&gt;You beat the snot out of all of them!</entry>
<entry name="main15_3">You==&gt;Hehe... Well... I guess you better go home for now.  It&apos;s not safe here.</entry>
<entry name="main15_4">T-Steak==&gt;Thanks for saving my life! Bye Bad Nerd!</entry>
<entry name="main15_5">I guess I&apos;ll go tell T-Bone  the good news in the Gym Washroom.</entry>

<entry name="main1_8">You==&gt;No, I don&apos;t want to be like the bullies..</entry>
<entry name="main1_9">Student==&gt;Ok.  Then I&apos;ll take your glasses!</entry>
<entry name="side3_29">Bullette==&gt;Well that&apos;s a bad move. You&apos;re gonna pay for being a nosy little nerd!</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_1">Panic Boy==&gt;Help!!  Help!!</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_2">You==&gt;What&apos;s going on?</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_3">Panic Boy==&gt;There&apos;s a group of kids who have gone nuts because they always get bullied!</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_4">You==&gt;Well, I don&apos;t blame them.  I just got bullied too!</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_5">Panic Boy==&gt;But they formed this club where they learn how to fight and they are going around the school practicing on everyone!</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_6">You==&gt;You mean they are beating everyone up for practice?</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_7">Panic Boy==&gt;Yeah, that&apos;s what one of them told me before they all started stomping on my face!</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_8">You==&gt;Well it&apos;s really none of my business.  But since they got bullied too, maybe they will hear me out.</entry>
<entry name="swarm1_9">Good work! But watch out! There&apos;s more!</entry>
<entry name="main1_10">You sent that kid to the infirmary.</entry>
<entry name="main1_11">You==&gt;Now what?  How do I get my comic books back?!?</entry>
<entry name="main1_12">Student==&gt;Hey you are new here right?</entry>
<entry name="main1_13">You==&gt; ... [Frown]</entry>
<entry name="main1_14">Student==&gt;I saw you get beat up and robbed of your comic books.</entry>
<entry name="main1_15">You==&gt;Yup, do you know where they put them? I&apos;d like to get them back.</entry>
<entry name="main1_16">Student==&gt;Yes I do.  But nothing  is free in this school.</entry>
<entry name="main1_17">You==&gt;What do you mean?</entry>
<entry name="main1_18">Student==&gt;Some bully took my chips.   If you get it back for me I&apos;ll tell you where your books went.</entry>
<entry name="main1_19">Student==&gt;He is at the far end of this hallway.</entry>
<entry name="zom6_1">You==&gt;Hi mister.  Do you know how to fix the light?</entry>
<entry name="main1_20">You==&gt;I guess I&apos;ll go back to that kid to give him his chips back.</entry>
<entry name="main1_21">Student==&gt;I&apos;m not telling you anything until you get me my chips.</entry>
<entry name="main1_22">Student==&gt;Come back when you have it.</entry>
<entry name="main1_23">Student==&gt;Do we have a deal?</entry>
<entry name="main1_24">You==&gt;Hi there,  may I please have that bag of chips?</entry>
<entry name="main1_25">You==&gt;I was told that you robbed it from that kid back there.</entry>
<entry name="main1_26">Bully==&gt;You wanna die? Nobody gets between me and my food!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_8">Strange Kid==&gt;Wait, when you beat them up, collect their drool.  If you drink it, it will infect you temporarily and give you zombie powers for a short time!</entry>
<entry name="zom11_9">You==&gt;Gross.... but ok I&apos;ll keep that in mind.</entry>
<entry name="main18_1">You==&gt;Wow!  I think I got all of them!</entry>

<entry name="gen_room_cleared6">You==&gt;That was fun!  Now... Where is that kid?  If he&apos;s not here I&apos;m not wating around for him!</entry>
<entry name="gen_room_cleared7">You==&gt;Gross... I got zombie drool all over my hands!  Hey Kid... Where are you?  If you don&apos;t show up soon I&apos;ll assume you died.  You can come out now.</entry>

<entry name="zom1_6">School Mate==&gt;Maybe you could go talk to him to see what he means. Since you are sort of a strange kid yourself, you might just know what he means!</entry>

<entry name="zom4_2">You==&gt;The new kid is playing a prank on the school to get revenge on the bullies.</entry>
